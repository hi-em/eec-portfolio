// THE BOOK'S CONTENTS, WITHOUT THE PROSE (2026-08-11).
//
// This module exists so `scripts/print-assets.mjs` can learn what to bake
// without evaluating a single spine. The spines are reached through
// `import.meta.glob`, which is a Vite construct and simply does not exist in
// Node, so any script bundling `bookContents.ts` died on it. That is one of
// two independent reasons the manual bake had become unrunnable, and neither
// was visible from the site: the committed JPEGs kept the tests passing while
// the command that regenerates them could not complete.
//
// So the book's MEMBERSHIP and its ASSET DECLARATIONS live here (data only,
// no prose, no glob), and bookContents.ts joins the spines on top for the
// renderer. One source, still.

// THE THOUGHT EACH PLATE NAMES (Emilie, 2026-08-16, picked one by one).
//
// The footer rail used to end on a MEASURED NUMBER, and only three of the
// eight had one: five plates carried a visible blank in a slot the eye had
// been trained to read, so five projects looked unmeasured. Filling the blanks
// was the obvious repair and she chose the better one — the rail now names the
// thought the project made her think of.
//
// It is the choice that makes the book argue its own thesis. The cover IS the
// mind graph and the index lists the thoughts; until now a reader had to infer
// that the work and the thinking are one nervous system. Every spread says it
// now, and the three numbers I traced were not wasted: they live on `stat`,
// which the site's own showcase renders.
//
// ⚠ THE DIRECTION IS NOT CONSISTENT, and that is why the rail says MADE ME
// THINK OF rather than LED TO. All seven of Sensi's threads point INTO Sensi —
// the thinking came first and the project applied it — while NeuroSpace points
// OUT to `scoring` and `drawiface`. A causal verb would be false on half the
// plates; an associative one is true on all of them.
//
// Six of these existed already; `soma` and `falcon` are the two threads she
// wrote into CORRELATIONS in the same pass. (2026-09-30, the book swap v2:
// Falcon left the book; Codependent's plate names `solvers`, physics solvers,
// her pick, a thread she added to CORRELATIONS for it.) Several projects carry more than
// one thread (Sensi has seven) and the pick is hers per project, NOT the
// strongest by strength — she overrode that on three of them. printBook's test
// asserts every id here is a real thought AND that the map actually carries a
// thread between the two, so the book can never name a relation the record
// does not have.

// THE ONE WORD THE RAIL DOES NOT SHOUT (Emilie, 2026-08-16).
//
// The rail sets every thought's title in caps, which is right for seven of the
// eight and fatal for the eighth: `behavior information modeling` is her
// coinage, and its short form carries a lowercase "e" that is the whole joke,
// because the argument is "keep the letters, change the noun". Uppercased it
// reads BEIM and the coinage dies on the page meant to announce it.
//
// So a thought may declare a printed form here, and a thought that declares one
// is printed VERBATIM rather than uppercased. Deliberately a map and not a
// flag: the next coinage will want its own spelling, not a boolean.
//
// ⚠ THE SPELLING ITSELF IS NOT AUTHORED HERE. The print layer composes and
// never authors (THE ECONOMY), and for one day this file held the string
// 'BeIM' while Pillar.tsx held a second copy typed by hand. Both now read
// PILLAR_SHORT from lib/pillar, beside the full phrase it abbreviates, so the
// lowercase "e" has exactly one place it can be lost.
//
// The pillar is also where the term is INTRODUCED, with a gloss in the
// sentence before it, because her standing rule (WORDS-BRIEF §2) is that the
// coinage never appears without one and a footer cannot carry a gloss. This
// rail is the echo, not the debut.
