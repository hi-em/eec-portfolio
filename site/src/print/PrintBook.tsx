// The /thoughts world printed as a cover: the better drawing, but it carries
// no words and the map is six times wider than it is tall, so any cover-shaped
// view of it is a window rather than the map. And the eight marked in RED and

// once the contents moved onto the CV page overleaf the numbers had no job on
// a drawing anyway.


// The lens inks, in print. Cyan, magenta and yellow are the printer’s own
// process inks, which is why print.css carries its own darker set rather than
// the screen pens: these have to hold on paper at 3.6px.
// Keyed by the mind graph’s own LensKey ('c' | 'p' | 'e' from landing/palette),
// not by the long lens names: the graph stores the short key and a long-name
// map silently resolves to nothing, which is exactly how the first draft of
// this came out uniformly black.

// have to recede behind the eight project names without vanishing on an office
// laser, and #565b63 put them level with the projects instead of under them.
// One step darker at the book audit (Emilie, 2026-08-18): at #9aa1ab the
// category labels were the page’s most likely dropout on a laser print.
// SNAPPED TO THE TOKEN at the consistency pass (her J ruling, 2026-08-19):
// #8b929c was one bit off --lang-ink-faint, which gave the book three faint
// greys within Δ1 of each other. Same recede, same laser survival, one grey.
const THREAD_GREY = '#8a919c'
// Every mark on the cover that is NOT one of the eight. Light enough to recede
// behind them, dark enough to survive an office laser: this is the drawing, not
// a watermark, and the shape of the graph still has to be readable.
// Snapped Δ6 darker onto the drawn-figure hairline grey (her J ruling,

              right on a screen and meaningless on paper: printed, that subset
              is just a scatter of names with no rule behind it. So the cover

              THREE THINGS ABOUT THIS LABEL, all hers on seeing the four drafted
              covers (2026-08-12):

              1. IT IS PAINTED IN ITS CATEGORY INK, the same ink as the mark it
                 belongs to. That does NOT breach print.css’s "red is never a
                 category": these are the three lens inks, and red stays the
                 emblem’s alone. It also keeps the sitewide rule that colour
                 never means alone, because the mark’s SHAPE still carries the
                 lens whether or not the ink survives a greyscale printer.
              2. IT IS CENTRED ABOVE THE MARK. ⚠ It sat BESIDE the mark for one
                 build, on my argument that a label on the baseline beside a dot
                 reads as attached to it. On the page it did the opposite: set
                 beside the mark the name runs INTO the threads to its right, and
                 "Falcon Square" printed with a curve through it. Reverted on her
                 sight of it, 2026-08-12. Above the mark the label has the one
                 direction on this drawing where nothing else is.
              2b. IT IS LIGHT. Bold at 14 made eight names shout over their own
                 drawing; 500 at 11.5 lets the marks stay the loudest thing.
              3. IT IS THE MASTER’S OWN TITLE, not the graph’s node label. The
                 graph stores an uppercase label for a screen, and uppercasing
                 loses the one thing lEgoarCh’s name is doing. */}

          compositions drawn against the real artwork).

          The old cover stacked two objects: the drawing in a 166mm band, then
          an identity rail underneath it. Her three notes on that page were the
          empty upper left, the labels, and the type reading as a slab. All
          three have one cause and one fix. The mind graph’s ink is dense in the
          centre and right and near-empty across the upper left, so THE NAME
          GOES IN THE EMPTINESS: the drawing now fills the whole page and bleeds
          off the bottom and the right, and the type sits inside it rather than
          under it. Nothing is cropped, and the fault becomes the frame.

          ⚠ THE AWARD LINE IS GONE FROM THE COVER, by her ruling: "I don’t want
          below my name to have awards and bla bla, just that this is the
          selected work portfolio 2026." One line replaces three. The award is
          not lost: it still leads the Sensi page that earned it, and it is
          still in the index. AWARD_FACT and SUBTITLE are no longer read here,
          which is why the cover’s old draftCopy note no longer applies to them.

          The standfirst went with it. That is not a second decision: page 2 now
          opens with the same VOICE line, and printing it twice in the first two
          pages was the stutter this pass has spent its time removing. */}

/* ---- 2b · THE ASSET PAGE -------------------------------------------------
   THE EDITORIAL PASS (Emilie, 2026-08-12). The first version of this page was
   a grid: every asset a rounded box inside a margin on all four sides, every
   asset in a row the same height, every caption the same size. Her verdict:
   "I would not want the stuff to be filleted, and want it to be more editorial
   like the first page. not all assets should be the same size."

   THE DIAGNOSIS THAT PRODUCED THIS LAYOUT. Page one is a COMPOSITION and page
   two was a GRID, and the difference is one move: on page one a single image
   dominates and BLEEDS OFF THE TRIM, so the type sits in a deliberate white
   shoulder beside it. Page two floated inside a box on all four sides. It also
   repeated three of page one’s four furniture elements verbatim (the same
   number, the same meta row, the same seam caption), which is a stutter rather
   than a rhyme. So this page now makes page one’s move instead of borrowing
   its trim.

   A LEAD AND A REGISTER. `bookLead` is promoted: it runs off two edges of the
   page and the head meta moves into the white beside it. `bookRegister` is one
   justified row, subordinate. The row still justifies, so every image keeps its
   true aspect and NOTHING IS EVER CROPPED, which matters because most of these
   are diagrams and a cropped diagram loses the labels that made it printable.

   ⚠ WHY FOUR ASSETS, AND WHY 04 DIED. Both were settled by measuring, not by
   taste, and the numbers are worth keeping because they will re-decide this if
   the assets change:
     · A full-bleed BAND across all 297mm ends 13mm PAST the trim on every one
       of the eight. The widest asset in the book is 2.47 and a band needs about
       3.2 to leave room for anything underneath. So a band is not a layout; it
       is this layout with a wide lead.
     · A register row of three is 42 to 46mm tall at this measure; a row of two
       is 65 to 73mm. Six assets therefore spend 130mm of a 178mm body and the
       lead collapses to 48mm, which is no longer a lead. At lead + three every
       project clears, with the lead between 54% and 71% of the page width.

   The geometry is computed, not guessed, because the page must be able to fail
   loudly. These numbers mirror print.css and scripts/print-assets.mjs, which
   sizes each baked image to the width it is actually drawn at. Change one,
   change all three. */

// The geometry lives in ./assetGeometry, which is pure and is imported by the
// bake script and the census test as well. It used to be copied into all three
// with a comment saying so; a wrong number in the bake script fails nothing and
// ships a soft image instead, which is invisible at A4.

/* ---- 4 · THE ABOUT PAGE ---------------------------------------------------
   THE CV CAME OUT (Emilie, 2026-08-12): "I am thinking of removing the CV and
   instead have an about instead and the index in this book design page."

   She was right and the reasons are worth keeping, because the CV page had
   survived two rounds of improvement before anyone asked whether it belonged.
   It was the ONE page in the book wearing another document’s typography (the
   CV’s pink rules, its icons, its 6.1pt body). It spent about six hundred words
   before a reader had seen a single project. Its right half was 60% empty. And
   it duplicated a document that already ships twice, as /cv and as a separate
   one-page PDF beside this one.

   HER PICK: option 03·B, "the book’s own grammar" with the ink. This page wears
   a PROJECT PAGE’S LAYOUT, at the same coordinates: the meta line at 46mm, the
   title at 58mm, the standfirst at 74mm, the columns from 100mm, the foot rule
   at 196mm, and page one’s 32mm white shoulder above all of it. So the book
   teaches its own structure one page before Sensi uses it.

   THE WORDS ARE NOT NEW. The prose is the landing BIO rendered verbatim from
   landing/identity.ts, which Emilie signed on 2026-08-06 and whose closing
   paragraph she wrote herself at round seven. Nothing on this page ships draft,
   which is the whole reason it reads in her voice: it is her voice.

   THE RECORD COLUMN WAS BUILT AND CUT. A third column carrying two schools,
   four roles and the languages was drawn and offered as the thing the book
   loses when the CV sheet goes. Her ruling, same day: "remove the record. no
   need for it in the book." So the page holds two columns and the white where
   the third one was, and the record lives where it always did, at /cv and in
   the CV PDF. The foot line still points at it. */

/**
 * The BIO’s two variables in italic, and nothing else.
 *
 * A LIST, NOT A HEURISTIC, and that distinction is load-bearing (see
 * landing/identity.ts): "italicise any standalone single letter" would catch
 * every "I" in the first paragraph. LandingCover does the same job for the
 * screen off the same BIO_VARIABLES export, so the two renditions cannot drift.
