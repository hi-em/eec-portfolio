// THE SHARE CARDS (S3, 2026-07-13; REDESIGN-SPEC R9, CONTENT-STRATEGY D6).
// /print/og/:cardKey renders ONE 1200x630 Open Graph card that
// scripts/prerender.mjs screenshots into /og/<cardKey>.png at build time:
//   work-<id>    one per project (title, the claim line, the recognition
//                line where real, the quiet P-number)
//   thought-<id> one per thought note (the lowercase serif title, the
//                signed opening, the quiet T-number)
//   pillar       the Behavior Information Modeling definition card
// Pen Table grammar (R9): the light ground og.png uses (DL section 4.5),
// ink type, the constellation cube with its one red node, NO lens colour
// (colour never travels without its shape tick, and a share card has no
// tick). All text is read from the registry + master files: the card is a
// RENDITION, nothing is authored here (THE ECONOMY).
// Print-surface rules (G5): unlinked, noindexed (usePrintDoc belt +
// robots.txt /print/ braces), lazy, outside the Chrome wrapper.

// EACH CARD NOW SHOWS THE THING IT IS ABOUT (Emilie, 2026-08-06: "revise the og
// cards of all possible links design to actually use the svg design of the
// thoughts and the cover of the projects, and the main website og cards").
//
// Before this every card, project and thought alike, carried a slice of the
// same mind graph. It was a real idea and it had one flaw she is naming: at
// thumbnail size in a feed, 40 cards of the same grey constellation are 40
// identical cards. A share card's whole job is to be recognisable before it is
// read, and the site already owns two things that do that instantly.
//
//   A THOUGHT gets its own PLATE, the ink figure that already opens the note.
//   A PROJECT gets its COVER, the same image the tile reveals and the book
//   prints, at the print rung.
//
// The mind-graph slice survives for the pillar and the landing, which are about
// the whole record rather than one piece of it, so there the constellation IS
// the subject.
