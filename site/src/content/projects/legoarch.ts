  // THE COVER = THE SOLVE, ALIVE (Emilie’s ask, 2026-07-15): Saint Basil’s
  // solving into its brick layout, still at rest, playing on hover; cut from
  // her sfx demo recording inside the app frame. The golden Sagrada render
  // moved into the flip-through (and stays the book plate below).

  // G5: the book spread’s dominant plate (print-assets.mjs bakes the rung).
  // THE PLATE MOVED (Emilie, 2026-08-11). It was sagrada-render, which was the
  // weakest image in the book at 1024px, was the one place the book broke this
  // project’s own rule (explanation or screenshot, never a product render),
  // and had left the manifest, which stopped `npm run print-assets` writing
  // anything at all. `outputs` replaces it: what goes in and what comes out,
  // fitted rather than cropped so the six labelled thumbnails all survive.
  spreadAssets: [{ slug: 'legoarch', name: 'outputs' }],
  // spreadFit left at round 2 (Emilie, 2026-08-19): the plate takes the
  // diagram's own ~1.88 ratio now, so the hero fills with no ground.
  // PAGE TWO: six self-titling slides, so even at a third of the page each one
  // still states its claim. The failure named out loud leads.
  // Her ruling was six claims in a grid. The editorial pass (2026-08-12) traded
  // two of them for a lead, because six assets leave the lead 48mm and it stops
  // leading. CUT: lora-sweep and perceptual-colour. What survives is the three
  // claims that are hardest to argue with.
  //
  // A BOTTOM LEAD, and this is the one project it suits best: the pipeline is
  // not an opening, it is the summation. The claims run across the top and the
  // machine that produced them anchors the foot. Only two pages in the book do
  // this, and both are pipelines.
  // ⚠ EVERY LEAD IS 'top-outer' (Emilie, 2026-08-12, on seeing the eight asset
  // pages side by side). The corner used to vary per project and the intent was
  // variety; laid out together it read as inconsistency, because a reader flips
  // the pair rhythm and the lead was in a different place five times out of
  // eight. Two of them were worse than inconsistent: a bottom lead puts the
  // REGISTER ABOVE THE LEAD, so the page is read bottom-up, and it inverts the
  // whole furniture block into a running head so the page loses its foot rule.
  // Her ruling: make all eight follow page 4. EVERY LEAD IS NOW AT THE TOP.
  // ⚠ But the EDGE still alternates, outer / bound / outer, because she asked
  // for exactly that one round earlier ("not always upper left, you know mix
  // and match") and printBook.test.tsx guards it. The two instructions are
  // compatible: what read as inconsistency on the contact sheet was the
  // BOTTOM and FIELD leads, not which trim edge a top lead bleeds from.
  // ⚠ THE ONLY FILLET LEFT IN THE BOOK WAS INSIDE THIS PICTURE (Emilie,
  // 2026-08-12: "remove the fillet, or crop the fillet out of the lead image").
  // The asset-page redesign removed the 2mm radius we were DRAWING on every
  // image, and then this lead turned out to be a cream card with a 30px corner
  // radius already baked in, so the one page still showing a rounded corner was
  // the one page where it was not ours to remove.
  // Measured on the source: 2px of white margin, 30px of radius, 1819 x 782.
  // 0.042 of the shorter side is 32px off every edge, which clears both.
