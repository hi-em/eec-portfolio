  // THE COVER = THE GROWTH, ALIVE (Emilie, 2026-07-15): the WASP aggregation
  // gif, still at rest, playing on hover; axonometric moved into the strip
  // and stays the book plate below.

  // G5: the book spread’s dominant plate (print-assets.mjs bakes the rung).
  // ⚠ NO spreadFit HERE, AND THAT IS THE RULE (Emilie, 2026-08-12): "for the
  // renders we can just crop and zoom in, because it won’t look wrong, it’s a
  // picture". A contain ground was BUILT for this plate and reverted on sight.
  // The distinction that came out of it: cropping a RENDER costs framing, and
  // cropping a SCREEN costs information. Sensi’s crop removed the panel that
  // proves the tool scores anything; this one removes some pavement.
  // Measured before deciding: this image’s bottom edge varies by 53 across the
  // strip (cars, awnings, palms), so no flat ground could ever match it and the
  // band printed as a slab.
  spreadAssets: [{ slug: 'huddle', name: 'axonometric' }],
  // PAGE TWO (Emilie, 2026-08-11): "wasp growth, panels, renders". The
  // aggregation and the panel logic on top, then three views from inside the
  // place. Page one is an axonometric with nobody in it; this page is where
  // Punta Arenas turns up.
  // Her order kept: "wasp growth, panels, renders". CUT: axonometric-zoom,
  // which is a close-up of the axonometric already filling the plate on the
  // facing page, so of the five it was the one that repeated rather than added.
  //
  // The growth study has to open the page (it is the first beat of her order),
  // so this lead stays at the top.
  // ASSET RETOUCH (2026-08-18, ruled): the sheet's right-hand "information
  // output" column — two WASP data tables plus their "WASP | information
  // output" caption (caption ink starts at x 2015 of 2538) — is illegible at
  // register size and is DROPPED; the crop keeps to x 2005 so caption, tables
  // and their carousel arrows all leave together (the context massing it
  // slices through bleeds off the edge like the rest of the map). The top
  // 1% goes with it: the tables sat 13px (~1mm) from the top trim, and with
  // them gone the first ink in the kept region starts at row 60 of 1271, so
  // nothing crowds the trim any more. Site-plan middle panel and the left
  // bubble-diagram stay. Measured off frame 0 of studio2.gif.
