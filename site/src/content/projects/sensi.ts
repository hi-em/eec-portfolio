  // THE COVER = THE GALAXY (Emilie’s pick at the desk, 2026-07-14): the sense

  // A PLATE NEVER CROPS (Emilie, 2026-08-12). The plate box is 145 x 96mm,
  // aspect 1.51, and the app screenshot is 1.88ish, so `cover` pushed a fifth of it
  // past the trim. On Sensi that was the entire SENSES / CONFLICTS column,
  // which is the part that proves the tool scores anything.
  // Stretching was drawn and rejected on sight: at 24% horizontal distortion
  // the app’s circular score badges print as ovals.
  // THE IMAGE IS CENTRED, so the ground shows as an equal band above and below
  // (Emilie, 2026-08-12: anchored to the top it "looks wrong", and she is right,
  // a single band under a picture reads as a slip rather than as a frame).
  // That means the ground has to match BOTH edges. Sensi is the plate where it
  // can: measured, the top strip is #151515 and the bottom #110f0e, both nearly
  // flat (variation 6 and 15), so one colour between them disappears at each.
  // spreadFit left at round 2 (Emilie, 2026-08-19): the plate takes the
  // screenshot's own ~1.88 ratio now, so the hero fills with no ground.

  // THE BOOK’S PAGE TWO (Emilie, 2026-08-11): "the system, then the thing".
  // act-2-flow leads at full width because Sensi’s explanatory images are
  // dense with small type and stop being information below about 150mm; the
  // three app shots under it are the copilot asking who you are, scoring a
  // real plan, and handing the report back. coupling-map and sensory-layer
  // lost their seats to that width, and the three demo gifs are near
  // duplicates of stills already here.
  // Her ruling: "1 · the system, then the thing". The flowchart leads and the
  // three screens follow it. Nothing was cut here: Sensi already carried
  // exactly four, which is the ceiling the register arithmetic sets.
  // The flowchart is the widest lead in the book at 2.15, so it runs 210mm and
  // stands 98mm, and the meta sits in the 77mm of white beside it.
