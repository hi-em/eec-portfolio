// THE SPINE of chair-sim: WHAT / WHY / HOW / WHAT CAME OF IT.
// Split out of chair-sim.tsx on 2026-08-03 (the phone pass). This module is
// LAZY: content/projects/index.ts reaches it through import.meta.glob, so a
// visitor downloads one project's prose, not all 21. The meta half stays in
// chair-sim.ts and is still statically barrelled, because the grid, the plate
// face, the CV line, headData and the OG card all need it synchronously.

  what: (
    <>
      An inflatable pillow mesh and a set of sitting stance meshes go into Kangaroo: pressure
      goals inflate the pillow, collision with the pose shapes it, and the settled mesh is
      captured as the chair. A voxelation pass then rebuilds it from a soft rubber ring module,
      with damping and voxel size as the two dials. Eight poses in the matrix, eight different
      chairs.
    </>
  ),
  why: (
    <>
      Because the honest way to design for a body is to let the body push back. The simulation
      does the ergonomics; the voxels point it toward something you could assemble from one
      repeated module.

  // HOW + OUTCOME added 2026-08-21 (her ask: every spine carries all four
  // beats). Her account in the fill-the-spines interview: the collision of
  // the sitting body forms the chair, one Grasshopper pipeline end to end,
  // trials for babies in the matrix; the caoutchouc realization (fun,
  // breathable, comfortable) is hers verbatim in spirit.
  how: [
    <>
      Let a sitting body do the designing: fix the posed human mesh and pressurize an inflatable pillow mesh against it in Kangaroo.
    </>,
    <>
      Rebuild the soft result with a voxel pass from one repeated caoutchouc ring module, damping and voxel size as the two dials.
    </>,
    <>
      Keep it one Grasshopper pipeline end to end, so swapping the sitter reruns everything: eight
      postures in the matrix, the trials for babies included.
    </>,
  ],
  outcome: (
    <>
      Two findings stayed. The material one: a chair built from caoutchouc rings could be fun,
      breathable and comfortable in the same object, giving where the body lands and airing where
      it does not. The method one: who is sitting matters as much as how. The pipeline that molds
      a chair around an adult reshapes it around a baby without a single redrawn line, which is
      the honest argument for simulating furniture instead of drawing it.
