  // else — where, with whom, when — which is the rule the other seven pages

  // puts a credit and why no page gains a PROJECT LEAD chip.

  question: "Can an airplane’s takeoff become a monument?",
  tech: 'RHINO · SUBD · ARCHVIZ',
  // THE BOOK (2026-08-11). Falcon joined this session as the second practice
  // page: Verve is delivery inside a big team, this one she led from the first
  // sketch, and a reader takes those as two different answers. PAGE TWO is
  // "her hand, then the geometry": both sketch sheets, then the wings pulled
  // apart and the plan they land in. The three 8000px process boards were left
  // out on purpose. Resolution is not their problem; their stage captions are
  // about half a percent of the image width, which lands near 1.8pt on paper,
  // so they can only work if one of them takes most of a page alone.
  spreadAssets: [{ slug: 'falcon', name: 'storm-takeoff-view' }],
  // INVERTED for print (Emilie, 2026-08-11). On screen these are white ink
  // flooded on black; on a page that is two large black rectangles, and an
  // office printer would hate them. Inverted they are what they always were,
  // pencil on paper with red annotations.
  // The captions are her signed alts with ONE clause changed, the one that
  // names a ground the printed version no longer has. draftCopy until signed.
  //
  // Her ruling: "1 · her hand, then the geometry". Already four, so nothing is
  // cut. At 1.36 the first sheet is the NARROWEST lead in the book (159mm),
  // which leaves the widest meta column of the eight: this is the one page
  // where the words sit properly beside the drawing rather than under it.
  // ⚠ THE MIRRORING BOARD LEADS (Emilie, 2026-08-14), and it is new to the book.
  // An 8001px process sheet that the SITE has never shown either, found while
  // looking for something to fill this page’s empty column.
  //
  // WHY IT EARNS THE LEAD. Falcon’s standfirst says the monument is "an
  // aircraft’s takeoff lines, mirrored twice into a steel falcon", and until now
  // NO IMAGE ON THE SPREAD SHOWED THAT. The sketches show her hand, the site
  // plan shows the result, the render shows the finished thing. This board shows
  // the move itself.
  //
  // ⚠ IT STAYS BLACK, and that knowingly reverses the reasoning three lines
  // below about the sketch sheets. They were inverted because a page carrying
  // TWO large black rectangles is hard on an office printer and unlike the
  // pencil drawings they really are. Her ruling: "I like the black as well, it
  // gives character." One black board against three white drawings is a
  // different proposition from a page of black, and it is her call.
  // It also keeps its own baked stage captions: at 185mm they land near 2.6pt,
  // so they read as texture in the graphic rather than as labels. Left alone at
  // her instruction to keep it as is.
  //
  // ⚠ THE EXPLODED AXO LEFT THE PAGE. At 101mm it was mostly white with thin red
  // slivers, and it was the only image here that is neither her hand nor the
  // finished thing.
