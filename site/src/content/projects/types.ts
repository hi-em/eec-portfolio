 *
 * Every asset page is an EVEN page, so `outer` is the left edge and `bound` is
 * the right one. The book alternates outer / bound down its whole length, and
 * varies the vertical only where the project's reading order allows it: a lead
 * at the bottom is read AFTER its register, so it is only ever given to a
 * project whose lead is a summation rather than an opening (lEgoarCh's
 * pipeline, NeuroSpace's pipeline). Sensi's flowchart, Huddle's growth study,
 * Ballooning's process and Falcon's first sketch sheet all have to come first
 * by Emilie's own per-project rulings, so those stay at the top.
 *
 * `field-*` is the full-height variant, which needs a portrait asset to be
 * worth doing. There is exactly one in the book (The Lungs' Speckle capture,
 * at 0.64), so there is exactly one field page.
 *
 * ⚠ A `bound` lead bleeds toward the GUTTER. That is fine for a PDF and for
 * loose sheets, which is how this leave-behind actually travels, and it would
 * lose a few millimetres into the spine if it were ever perfect-bound. Traded
 * knowingly for the variation she asked for, not overlooked.

// project under content/projects/ is the canonical home of everything the
// project SAYS: the card copy that used to live in data/projects.tsx plus the
// showcase spine. The /work card, the opened showcase, and later the book
// spread and the CV line are RENDITIONS of this one object. The registry
// (data/registry.ts) stays the single INDEX: dates, numbers, tags, joins.
//
// THE SPINE (signed by Emilie in the G1 director session, 2026-07-10):
// WHAT · WHY · HOW · WHAT CAME OF IT, then the tools, then the links out.
// WHAT and WHY are authored for every project. HOW and OUTCOME render only
// where real material exists: a thin project is honestly short, never padded
// (no slot begs to be filled). Winks ride inline as the <NB> hover dot, one
// per project at most, only where a good one already exists.
//
// Copy rules that bind every field (REDESIGN-SPEC §0): attribution woven into
// prose as ordinary sentences, never labelled lines or percentages; verbs
// score / estimate / model, never measure; Lungs "designed to filter";
// lEgoarCh's instructive fail is narrated without its percentage; Emilie's
// voice, NO em dashes; new prose ships showcaseDraft: true until she signs it.
//
// ONE PROJECT, TWO HALVES (2026-08-03, the phone pass). The master is still one
// idea, but it now lives in two files because the two halves have completely
// different audiences:
//
//   ProjectMeta   <slug>.ts        JSX-free. The grid face, the CV line, the OG
//                                  card, headData and the sitemap all need it,
//                                  synchronously, on every route. Statically
//                                  barrelled by index.ts.
//   ProjectSpine  <slug>.spine.tsx The four ReactNode beats. Exactly ONE surface
//                                  reads them (the opened showcase), so they are

//                                  import.meta.glob.
//
// Measured before the split: data/work.ts materialised all 21 spines at module
// scope, so `work-*.js` was 61.4KB and any import from it — including
// WORK_LENSES, three strings — pulled every project's prose. It was preloaded on

  // THE BOOK'S SECOND PAGE (2026-08-11): the asset grid facing the project
  // page. Curated with Emilie project by project, because the right count and
  // arrangement depend entirely on what shape that project's images are: a
  // page of 2:1 slides and a page holding a portrait Speckle capture beside a
  // square plan are not the same page.
  //
  // A LEAD AND A REGISTER, not a grid (Emilie, 2026-08-12, the editorial
  // pass). The grid was the complaint: "not all assets should be the same
  // size", and "more editorial like the first page". Page one is a
  // composition because ONE image dominates and BLEEDS OFF THE TRIM, so page
  // two now makes the same move. `bookLead` is the promoted asset and the
  // corner it bleeds from; `bookRegister` is the subordinate row beneath or
  // beside it.
  //
  // WHY FOUR ASSETS AND NOT SIX, measured rather than judged. A register row
  // of three is 42 to 46mm tall at this measure; a row of two is 65 to 73mm.
  // With six assets the register eats 130mm of the 178mm body, which leaves
  // the lead 48mm and it stops being a lead. At lead + three every project in
  // the book clears with the lead at 54 to 71% of the page width. The surplus
  // assets each project used to carry were cut by Emilie, one at a time,
  // against that arithmetic; the cut ones are recorded in each master.
  //
  // A ROW STILL JUSTIFIES: every image keeps its true aspect and the row's
  // widths divide in proportion to them, so nothing is ever cropped and a
  // portrait capture simply takes a narrow column beside a wide diagram. This
  // is also what lets print-assets.mjs bake each image to the width it is
  // actually drawn at (~220dpi, invisible on screen and on an office printer),
  // which is what keeps a 20-page book under the mail ceiling.
  //
  // `invert` flips a drawing that was scanned or exported white-on-black back
  // to ink-on-paper (Emilie, 2026-08-11, on the falcon sketches: two flooded
  // black rectangles on a printed page, where the same drawing dark-on-white is
  // closer to what it actually is). The bake inverts LIGHTNESS and rotates the
  // hue back, because a straight negative turns her red annotations cyan.
  //
  // `caption` overrides the manifest alt FOR PRINT ONLY. It exists for exactly
  // one reason: an inverted drawing's signed alt can describe the ground it no
  // longer has ("ink sketches ON BLACK", printed on white). The site keeps her
  // wording because there the description is still true. Any override ships
  // draftCopy until she signs it.
