// THE MASTER CONTENT INDEX (G1). One project per pair of files in this folder;
// this index assembles them in the canonical lens order the old projects store
// used (computation heroes, then practice, then explorations). Adding a project
// = one registry entry + one meta file + one spine file here (THE ECONOMY).
//
// TWO HALVES, TWO LOADING STRATEGIES (2026-08-03, the phone pass; see types.ts
// for the why). The META half is statically barrelled below, because the grid
// face, the CV line, headData, the sitemap and the OG card all read it
// synchronously on routes that never open a project. The SPINE half is reached
// through import.meta.glob in LAZY mode, so opening one project downloads one
// project's prose.
//
// Measured before: `work-*.js` was 61.4KB, every byte of it in the graph of any
// module that touched data/work.ts, and preloaded on /cv and /rights.
//
// This is the same shape thoughts/openings.ts already uses for the notes: the
// index surfaces get the JSX-free half, the leaf gets the prose.
