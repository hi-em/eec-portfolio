  // prints the coinage’s short form, so the whole stack fits with room to
  // spare. If this line ever grows, printBook.test.tsx fails with the measured

  // THE PLATE MOVED (Emilie, 2026-08-11): `landing` is the marketing page, all

  spreadAssets: [{ slug: 'neurospace', name: 'view' }],
  // FITTED, not cropped (Emilie, 2026-08-11). Filling the plate cut the slider
  // panel off one edge; cropping the other way saved the sliders and lost the
  // score. Both are the point of the tool, so it fits whole on the app’s own
  // near-white ground, where the letterbox is invisible.
  // ⚠ THE GROUND WAS RESAMPLED (2026-08-12). It was #f4f5f6, chosen by eye, and
  // measuring the image showed why it never sat right: the plate’s real edges are
  // MID GREY (#a5a3a0 at the top, #b4aeac at the bottom), so a near-white band
  // blended with the PAGE and not with the PICTURE, and the seam showed on every
  // print. Split further, the left 18% is the parameters panel (#ebe9e8) and the
  // right 82% is the 3D viewport (#959491), so no flat colour is exact; the
  // viewport dominates and the value below is the mean of the two edge strips.
  // The ground’s job is to be the plate’s own field, which means matching the
  // image rather than the paper. Same reasoning as Sensi’s near-black.
  // spreadFit left at round 2 (Emilie, 2026-08-19): the plate takes the
  // screenshot's own ~1.88 ratio now, so the hero fills with no ground.
  // PAGE TWO: four large. How it is built, what the score is actually made of,
  // and the two report pages it produces. pipeline and score-formula are 875px
  // originals, all that exists, so they get the largest size they can honestly
  // carry rather than being blown up.
  // Already four, so nothing is cut. At 1.54 the pipeline is the SQUAREST lead
  // in the book, which means it stands 123mm tall against a 190mm width and
  // leaves the shallowest meta column of the eight.
  //
  // The second of the two bottom leads, for the same reason as lEgoarCh’s: the
  // formula and the two scored rooms are the evidence, and the pipeline is what
  // made them, so it reads better underneath than above.
  // ⚠ EVERY LEAD IS 'top-outer' (Emilie, 2026-08-12, on seeing the eight asset
  // pages side by side). The corner used to vary per project and the intent was
  // variety; laid out together it read as inconsistency, because a reader flips
  // the pair rhythm and the lead was in a different place five times out of
  // eight. Two of them were worse than inconsistent: a bottom lead puts the
  // REGISTER ABOVE THE LEAD, so the page is read bottom-up, and it inverts the
  // whole furniture block into a running head so the page loses its foot rule.
  // Her ruling: make all eight follow page 4. EVERY LEAD IS NOW AT THE TOP.
  // ⚠ But the EDGE still alternates, outer / bound / outer, because she asked
  // for exactly that one round earlier ("not always upper left, you know mix
  // and match") and printBook.test.tsx guards it. The two instructions are
  // compatible: what read as inconsistency on the contact sheet was the
  // BOTTOM and FIELD leads, not which trim edge a top lead bleeds from.
  // ⚠ THE LEAD IS A DRAWING THE BOOK MAKES, not a picture of a diagram
  // (Emilie, 2026-08-12: "I don’t like both diagrams, they feel like they don’t
  // fit the aesthetic and they are too small ... if there is a way to merge them
  // into one new meta diagram").
  //
  // What was here: `pipeline`, an exported architecture diagram in coloured
  // rounded boxes and another type family, 875px drawn 171mm wide, about
  // 130dpi. Beside it in the register sat `score-formula`, the same problem
  // twice. They were the only two assets the census had to sanction on
  // resolution, and they were the only two pictures in the book carrying type
  // that is not the book’s.
  //
  // What replaced them: ONE figure, src/print/figures.tsx, drawn in the book’s
  // ink and set in its own mono. It merges both because they are two halves of
  // the same sentence, and that sentence is already signed in the spine: the
  // server returns geometry on the slow path, the browser returns a score on the
  // fast one. Being vector it has no resolution, so the exception disappears
  // rather than being sanctioned again.
  //
  // ⚠ THE DRAWING IS draftCopy until Emilie signs it. It states nothing the
  // record does not: four HOW steps, five weights off the formula sheet, and
  // that sheet’s own four bands.
  //
  // The knock-on is the reason it is worth doing twice over: absorbing the
  // formula sheet takes page two from four assets to three, so the two report
  // screens are drawn 130mm wide instead of 87, which is where their dials and
  // contribution bars stop being decoration.
