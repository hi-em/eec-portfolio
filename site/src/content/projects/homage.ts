// Her LAU bachelor final-year thesis: adaptive reuse of Oscar Niemeyer's

// HONESTY CEILING (verified against the certificate on disk AND
// tamayouz-award.com, 2026-07-16): the recognition is Top 100 Architecture

// individuals, 141 universities, 36 countries), NEVER "winner".

// Supervisor Issam Barhouch credited (named on the public Tamayouz page).
// ALL COPY SIGNED by Emilie (S2 sign-off, 2026-07-17), the board-sourced
