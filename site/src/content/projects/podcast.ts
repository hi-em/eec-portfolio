// P-107 · Optimizing for the Mind (the podcast, the listening member).
// HONESTY CORRECTION (2026-07-15): the prior pullQuote + blurb quoted "There
// is no standard, anywhere in the world, that measures whether a building is
// good for your brain" as Dr. Cleo Valentine — that line is NOT in the
// transcript (incoming/podcast/_script.txt, 23pp). It was a fabricated
// attribution to a real person and is REPLACED with verbatim quotes checked
// against the transcript. The quantified research (qEEG etc.) is Dr.
// Valentine's, never Emilie's: the spine stays on the conversation and the
// coined term. No HOW: a conversation, not a pipeline. The rewritten copy
// (dek, pull quote, spine, the 7 verbatim quote cards, the alts) was
// RE-SIGNED by Emilie (REINDEX batch B, 2026-07-16); the quotes stay
// verbatim and Dr. Valentine's science diagrams stay out, binding.
