// THE SPINE of tsukiji: WHAT / WHY / HOW / WHAT CAME OF IT.
// Split out of tsukiji.tsx on 2026-08-03 (the phone pass). This module is
// LAZY: content/projects/index.ts reaches it through import.meta.glob, so a
// visitor downloads one project's prose, not all 21. The meta half stays in
// tsukiji.ts and is still statically barrelled, because the grid, the plate
// face, the CV line, headData and the OG card all need it synchronously.

  what: (
    <>
      A computational environmental analysis of the proposed 19-hectare redevelopment of Tokyo’s
      Tsukiji fish market site. We simulated thermal comfort, daylight, wind and heat mitigation
      under a climate that swings from wet and cold to hot and humid inside a single day. A team
      of four: Charles Abi Chahine, Lakzhmy Mari Zaro, María Sánchez
      Domínguez and me.
    </>
  ),
  why: (
    <>
      If it is hard to simply dress for Tokyo’s weather, imagine designing a 19-hectare venue for
      it. Environmental analysis is where a form’s good intentions meet a climate that does not
      care.
    </>
  ),
  how: [
    <>
      Model the site and venue in Rhino and run Ladybug and Infrared.City across thermal comfort,
      daylight, wind and heat.
    </>,
    <>Test the starting hypothesis: that minor modifications to the original form would be enough.</>,
    <>
      When they were not, reshape the form itself, with Galapagos searching the roof geometry for
      a shape that performs.
    </>,
  ],
  outcome: (
    <>
      The simulations killed the polite version: minor modifications had minimal impact on
      environmental performance, so the massing changed. The honest lesson is that environmental
      analysis is a design partner, not a report you attach at the end.
