// THE SPINE of sensi: WHAT / WHY / HOW / WHAT CAME OF IT.
// Split out of sensi.tsx on 2026-08-03 (the phone pass). This module is
// LAZY: content/projects/index.ts reaches it through import.meta.glob, so a
// visitor downloads one project’s prose, not all 21. The meta half stays in
// sensi.ts and is still statically barrelled, because the grid, the plate
// face, the CV line, headData and the OG card all need it synchronously.

  what: (
    <>
      Every tool in the stack could tell us how a building performs. None of them would say how a
      room feels. Sensi closes that gap: a copilot that reads a floor plan and scores comfort
      across six senses (thermal, visual, acoustic, spatial, olfactory, tactile), calibrated to
      one person at a time, not an average. It was prototyped first as an MCP tool, then rebuilt
      as a standalone app. Project lead, A to Z, built by a team of four: Lakzhmy Mari Zaro,
      María Sánchez Domínguez, Charles Abi Chahine and me.

  why: (
    <>
      {/* A statement, no I and no we (Emilie, 2026-09-10, the walkthrough
          reopen): the motivation reads as the project's, not a person's. */}
      Comfort is usually the thing that shows up, or does not, after the design is done. Sensi
      makes it a layer you can interrogate while the plan is still soft, because you do not walk
      into a room and average your experience: the thing that is wrong is the thing you notice.
      And nothing you fix stays fixed alone: the whole project is the ripple, what a change drags
      along.

  how: [
    <>
      Onboarding calibrates the copilot to one person, their thermal grudges, their noise
      tolerance.

    <>
      {/* The evals clause (the researcher pass, Emilie 2026-08-26, "c and a
          mix"): drafted from the repo's own code — nodes/quality/evaluator.py
          gates every reply APPROVED or REVISE, nodes/scoring/
          suggestion_critic.py reads each suggestion for feasibility and
          cross-sense consequences. draftCopy until she signs the words. */}
      One action classifier, a single LLM call per turn, routes each request through a LangGraph
      state graph: analyze, edit, preview, audit. Two evals ride inside it: a critic reads every
      suggestion for cross-sense damage, and an evaluator reads every reply before you do.
    </>,
    <>
      A coupling matrix ripples every change into the neighboring senses, so a fix that quietly
      breaks another score gets flagged, not hidden.
      <NB note={'the six scores argue like a family. the coupling matrix is the dinner table.'} />
    </>,
    <>
      The copilot suggests edits the layout can absorb and previews them without committing: a
      vision model redraws the room’s atmosphere while keeping its structure, then hands over the
      comparison and the report.

  outcome: (
    <>
      We benched the judgment before trusting it: two LLM providers scored the same three scenes
      end to end, including a living room arranged to fail. They mostly agreed, and it would have
      been easy to call that validation. We wrote agreement is not truth into the notes instead,
      and kept every disagreement as data.
      {/* The a sentence (same ruling): drafted from bench_quality.py — the
          blind A/B that replays each node's captured prompts through the old
          and new model before a swap is adopted. draftCopy until signed. */}{' '}
      That habit hardened into evals: swap a model and the same apartment replays through the
      same captured prompts, old against new, judged blind before the swap is believed.
      {/* THE LIMITS (Emilie, 2026-09-10, after the Hesham Shawqy review): the
          walkthrough ends on what the built tool does not do, in the order she
          ruled: validation first, then estimates, then the labelled couplings.
          Facts from the repo: README ("it models and estimates; it does not
          measure"), python/comfort/sense_model.py (every coupling tagged
          verified or inferred). draftCopy until she signs the words. */}{' '}
      Nobody has stood in a room Sensi scored and told us whether it was right: there is no human
      validation. It estimates, it does not measure, and every coupling in the code wears a label,
      verified or inferred, so you can see which links rest on published research and which on our
      own reasoning.
