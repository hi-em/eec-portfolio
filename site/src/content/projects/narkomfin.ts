// P-112 · Narkomfin as a Graph (S4b, 2026-07-14). Authored fresh from the
// public blog post (content/blog-catalog.json): no sheet ever existed.
// HONESTY (binding): applied, team-context ML, never ML-lead framing; the
// accuracy figures are the TEAM's results, woven as prose, and the model
// scoring the communal units as rule-breaking is the finding, not a win.
// Emilie at the S4b copy gate (2026-07-14) chose the SHARED credit over the
// dossier's individual-slice line, knowing the tradeoff; recorded for the
// next dossier extension. Dek + spine + credit row SIGNED at the same gate.
