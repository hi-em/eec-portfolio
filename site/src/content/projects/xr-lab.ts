// P-111 · XR for Education (explorations). S2 FIX ROUND (2026-07-16): the
// spine rewritten from Emilie's own telling. Her two guiding questions,
// near-verbatim, are the WHY ("chem students dont have the best
// visualization skills so how can we teach them something crucial... in a
// visual way? and how to make something relatively boring and too technical
// into something immersive and fun"); the pipeline is the HOW (reactions
// modeled and animated in 3ds Max and Maya, imported into Unity, run on
// Oculus headsets); the OUTCOME keeps her ceiling exactly: engagement was
// visibly higher in the trials, the research never went deeper, she
// graduated and left the team. Her LinkedIn record (Research Assistant, XR
// Learning Experiences, LAU, Sep 2021 - Jan 2023) backs the frame,
// including contributions to research papers and documentation.
// HONESTY red line held: no personal C# claim, no measured-outcome claim.
// ALL COPY SIGNED by Emilie (S2 sign-off, 2026-07-17).
