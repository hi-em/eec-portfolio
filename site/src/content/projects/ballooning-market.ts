  // THE QUESTION (D4 round 2, Emilie 2026-07-14: she hated the mess line as

  question: 'Can balloons roof a historic market without touching it? A pneumatic simulation.',

  // ⚠ THE ALGORITHM LEADS, AND EVERY BAKED HEADING IS CROPPED OFF (Emilie,
  // 2026-08-12). Two decisions, and the second is the one that matters.
  //
  // THE LEAD. The Grasshopper algorithm is the densest asset here and it was
  // sitting in the register at 88mm, where its boxes and arrows are decoration.
  // At 210mm they are readable. The cost is that the four-stage inflation sheet
  // drops to a register width and its own stage labels stop being legible, which
  // is survivable because the book’s caption already names those four stages.
  //
  // THE CROPS. Every asset on this page arrived with its own title burnt in
  // ("// ballooooooning", "// the algorithm", "// epic fails") plus its own red
  // stage labels and grey descriptions. Printed, the lead’s heading set LARGER
  // THAN THE PROJECT TITLE on the facing page, in a face the book uses nowhere
  // else: two title systems, two caption systems, one spread.
  // Her ruling: crop them, and let the book’s full captions do the labelling.
  //
  // The bands below are MEASURED off each image’s own row-by-row ink profile,
  // not guessed. algorithm: heading occupies 4-11% of the height, drawing runs
  // 18-98%. process: heading 6-13%, drawing 34-63%, red labels 77-79%,
  // descriptions 85-97%. epic-fails: heading 5-13%, drawing 27-78%, error
  // labels 85-93%.

  // ⚠ epic-fails LEFT THE PAGE, and the crops are why (Emilie, 2026-08-12:
  // "I like how it is without the labels but there is something off about the
  // secondary asset row ... let’s remove the epic fails here and just make the
  // two assets bigger").
  //
  // The chain is worth writing down because it is not obvious: cropping the
  // baked headings and stage labels off makes an image WIDER (process went from
  // 2.07 to 4.40, epic-fails from 2.06 to 3.37), and a justified row hands out
  // width in proportion to aspect, so three wide assets sharing one measure gave
  // a 27mm row and a 48mm render. Two give a 42mm row, a 186mm process sheet and
  // a 76mm render. REMOVING BAKED TEXT COSTS REGISTER HEIGHT, and this is what
  // paying for it looks like.
  //
  // Nothing is lost by dropping it: the failures are told in the facing page’s
  // own WHAT CAME OF IT, "the balloons had no physical awareness of each other,
  // just ghosting through one another in a chaotic, colorful mess". The picture
  // was the second telling, not the only one.

    // render-3 has ONE figure doing ONE thing, which is what survives small.
    // It also earns its place in the sequence rather than just filling it: the
    // algorithm above ends on `spine tunnel`, and this is the spine tunnel, so
    // the register reads as cause and effect.
    // ⚠ chromatic-study was the other candidate and is NOT a render: it is a
    // studio sheet with "// rgb glitch" baked in, the exact thing this page just
    // finished cropping off everything else.

  // The distinction that came out of it: cropping a RENDER costs framing, and

  // proves the tool scores anything; this one removes some pavement.

  // PAGE TWO (Emilie, 2026-08-11): four method, two renders. Everything this

  // crop half the book. epic-fails earns its place ahead of prettier frames:
  // the two errors are named on the slide, which is the account of what the
  // machine got wrong that almost nobody prints.
  // Her ruling was "1 · four method, two renders". At four assets that becomes
  // the process promoted, two methods, and ONE render. CUT: design-matrix, and
  // render-3, which was the second of two renders where souk-interior is the
  // better one. The process sheet opens the page because it is the first beat
  // of her order.
  // ⚠ EVERY LEAD IS 'top-outer' (Emilie, 2026-08-12, on seeing the eight asset
  // pages side by side). The corner used to vary per project and the intent was
  // variety; laid out together it read as inconsistency, because a reader flips
  // the pair rhythm and the lead was in a different place five times out of
  // eight. Two of them were worse than inconsistent: a bottom lead puts the
  // REGISTER ABOVE THE LEAD, so the page is read bottom-up, and it inverts the
  // whole furniture block into a running head so the page loses its foot rule.
  // Her ruling: make all eight follow page 4. EVERY LEAD IS NOW AT THE TOP.
  // ⚠ But the EDGE still alternates, outer / bound / outer, because she asked
  // for exactly that one round earlier ("not always upper left, you know mix
  // and match") and printBook.test.tsx guards it. The two instructions are
  // compatible: what read as inconsistency on the contact sheet was the
  // BOTTOM and FIELD leads, not which trim edge a top lead bleeds from.
