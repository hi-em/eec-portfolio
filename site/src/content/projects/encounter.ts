// P-117 · The Encounter (practice). S2 fix round (2026-07-16): the Jemma
// internship year SPLIT into its two competitions at Emilie's call; her role
// title is ARCHITECTURAL DESIGNER (her LinkedIn record, her explicit
// correction of the CV's "Architectural Intern"; CV alignment routed to
// Phase 2). The Anfeh cemetery competition by Ctrl Act Design.
// HONESTY CEILING (certificate on disk): "Shortlisted as finalist", a
// recognition, never a win. Her part, in her words: concept support, the
// landscape planning, the trials for the tomb details, and rendering with
// the team. The FINALIST pill links the certificate raster (her call: no
// public results URL exists); the office's project page is in the links row.
// ALL COPY SIGNED by Emilie (S2 sign-off, 2026-07-17).
