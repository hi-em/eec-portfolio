// THE SMALL PRINT (/rights, THE RIGHTS PASS 2026-07-30).
//
// WHY THIS PAGE EXISTS. She publishes a lot of work she did not solely make,
// and the site collects three fields through a third party, and none of it was
// written down anywhere a visitor could read it. The credit layer was already
// at the professional standard (every collaborator named in prose beside their
// project, every employer named in its credit row); what was missing was the
// paperwork.
//
// HER RULINGS THAT SHAPE IT (2026-07-30):
//   - a SMALL page, Foster + Partners' MANNER (quiet headings, plain
//     sentences, nothing busy) and not its scale. Foster runs six policy
//     sub-pages and a named Data Protection Manager; copying that structure
//     here would be theatre.
//   - reachable from the FOOTLINE ONLY. Never a fifth door: the header pill is
//     frozen and pixel-identical on every page by her own ruling, and a rights
//     page has not earned equal billing with the work.
//   - SHAPE C, the hybrid: prose for the three sections that are positions,
//     a ruled list for the colophon, because fonts and datasets genuinely ARE
//     a list. Nothing is dressed as the wrong thing.
//   - COLLAPSIBLE, ALL FOUR CLOSED (round 2): "the small print page things
//     should be collapsible not all open at once". The page is a set of rules
//     you open, not a document you scroll. See Section below for why it is a
//     native <details> and not an accordion component.
//   - NO MIT anywhere. She owns the copyright either way; MIT is permission,
//     not ownership.
//
// THE LEGO LINE IS HERS ALREADY. lEgoarCh's own app carries the disclaimer
// LEGO's Fair Play guidelines ask for, and has since the project shipped. It
// is lifted from the app rather than reinvented, minus its em dash.
//
// THE TONE IS THE EXCEPTION TO THE WHOLE SITE, and it is a standing ruling
// (2026-07-30, after she read the first draft live): "the words of the small
// print i want them to be short and straight to the point and not warm, full
// competence and seriousness. it's the only page where i want full serious
// mode in tone."
//
// So the voice rules in `/emilie-voice` DO NOT APPLY HERE, and that is
// deliberate rather than an oversight. No jokes, no self-deprecation, no
// mid-paragraph questions, no warmth, no triples, no one-word punchlines.
// Everywhere else on this site, warmth is the point. Here, competence is.
//
// IT TOOK THREE DRAFTS AND THE THIRD CHANGED FORMAT, NOT WORDING. Two rounds
// of prose were rejected ("I still don't like the words there and the way we
// are sounding"), which was the signal that the problem was not the phrasing
// but that prose has a voice at all. She was given three registers side by
// side, with the same facts in each: THE NOTICE (prose stripped to the bone),
// THE LEDGER (label and value, no prose), and THE CLAUSE (numbered, formal,
// impersonal). **She chose THE CLAUSE.** My recommendation was the ledger and
// I named the risk in the clause before she picked it: third person reads as a
// firm rather than a person, and it is the closest this site comes to the
// terms-of-service maze she ruled out at the start. Her call, built as shown.
//
// Casualties of the three drafts, all decent lines, none of them missed: "it
// is shorter than you are expecting", "I would rather you check than take my
// word for it", "the honest answer is usually yes", "one very famous brick",
// and "I can see that a page was read. I cannot see that it was you."
//
// ALL COPY ON THIS PAGE SHIPS DRAFT until she signs it (draftCopy, the
// standing gate). No em dashes. ZERO job-search signal: this page says what is
// owned and what is collected, and never once that anyone is available.

// NATIVE <details>/<summary>, NO JAVASCRIPT. That is not laziness, it buys four
// things a hand-rolled accordion would have to reimplement and usually gets
// wrong: it opens with the keyboard, a screen reader announces it as expanded or
// collapsed without a single aria attribute from us, the browser's own find (and
// Chrome's "scroll to text fragment" from a search result) opens a closed
// section to reveal a match, and it still works if the page never finishes
// booting. It also survives print, which matters on a site that prints itself.
//
// THE MARKER IS A PLUS THAT BECOMES A MINUS, drawn as text and swapped by the
// `[&[open]]` variant. `list-none` + the webkit pseudo-element kill the default
// disclosure triangle, which is the one piece of platform chrome that would not
