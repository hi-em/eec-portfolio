// THE GALLERY (Session R2, re-skinned DL-2 2026-07-10) · /work. A uniform grid
// of every project where a visitor browses the work visually, then opens any
// card as a glass sheet lifted over the dimmed grid. This is the landing's
// proof path, so it must be excellent and fast.
//
// One data object drives it: WORK_ENTRIES (data/work.ts), the same object the
// printed book's INDEX page (R7) will reuse. The lens filter is an OPEN facet
// set (a new lens appears by itself). The overlay is URL-addressable at
// /work/:id so a single card is shareable and prerenderable (R9).
//
// DL-2: the page simply FOLLOWS the mode (the R2 dark lean retired at DL-1);
// faces are the glass Card primitive, the filter is FilterPill, the preview is
// the glass-2 sheet, and the card <-> sheet <-> page morphs ride the DL-1
// naming convention (lib/viewTransition.ts).
//
// Copy: all 11 deks were SIGNED by Emilie in the DL-2 copy pass (in chat,
// 2026-07-10; dekSigned in the content files); the page's intro line retired
// at G2 (no page intros, sitewide). New copy on this surface ships draftCopy
// until she signs it, as always (Section 14).

          row that runs past the frame is a gesture the page has taught once.
          `-mx-5` cancels SheetPage's gutter so the row bleeds the full width and
          keeps that gutter as its own first inset, exactly like HorizontalBelt.
          THE BOOK IS GONE FROM HERE: it lives in the footer at every width now

          It moved into the LENS drawer on 2026-08-03 and the honest cost was
          written down at the time: "a filter behind a tab is a filter a
          first-time visitor has to find". Shown the measurement — /work is only
          2.6 screens deep, so filtering here saves under two flicks, against
          /cv's 4.1 screens and five sections — she ruled the drawer earns its
          place in the rooms where it saves real work and not in this one.

          The second reason, and the better one: the row is not only a control.
          Four words sitting under the header SAY there are three kinds of work
          in this room. A tab labelled LENS cannot say that to someone who has
          never pressed it.

          It costs back the ~72px above the first tile that the drawer bought,
          which is a real give-back and is why she was shown the number first.
          Everything about the row itself is unchanged from 2026-08-02: one
          scrolling line, short lens names with the long ones as accessible
