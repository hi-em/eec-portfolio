// THE NEURAL WORLD · the pure model (the meta build, 2026-07-11).
// /thoughts draws the whole record (projects + thoughts + milestones +
// awards) as one anatomical neural map over the career skeleton, horizontal,
// 2021 › NOW. This module owns ALL the geometry: positions, dendrites,
// skeleton lanes, correlation fibres. No DOM, no React (Node-testable, the
// landing mindGraph.ts pattern); NeuralWorld.tsx renders it, the validator
// asserts its joins, worldGraph.test.ts freezes its layout.
//
// THE ECONOMY + THE FREEZE (binding):
// - Node CONTENT comes from the registry (single source). The correlations
//   are registry data too (CORRELATIONS + award refIds).
// - X is a FIXED STEP per chronological rank (never a fraction of a fixed
//   width): the viewBox WIDTH is derived from the census, so new work
//   APPENDS to the right and no shipped coordinate moves. Randomness seeds
//   from the entry ID (never the rank), so an append can never reshuffle an
//   existing neuron's anatomy. Residual contract (documented, snapshot-
//   guarded): inserting an entry with an OLD date shifts the ranks after it;
//   real appends are new work at the newest date, which only extends the
//   right edge.

//
// Her brief, verbatim: "there should be no rule on whether the thoughts come
// before or after the project, it should be date based, and based on the
// correlation to the other projects and thoughts ... this will also help read
// things."
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES. Ties inside a month used to break on kind, alphabetically
// (award < milestone < project < thought), so thoughts always landed last in
// their month whatever they were connected to. And y was a sine of the node's
// RANK, which is a decorative wave: a node's height said nothing about what it
// was threaded to, so a fibre's length and direction were accidents.
//
// WHAT IT IS NOW. This is a layered graph drawing, which is the standard shape
// for a graph whose one axis is fixed:
//   · The LAYER is the month. Time owns x and nothing here may move it.
//   · Within a layer, and then for y, each node is pulled to the BARYCENTRE of
//     its neighbours: the average position of the things it actually threads to.
//     That is the classic crossing-reduction heuristic, and it is exactly her
//     sentence: adjacency sits in relation to narkomfin and urban-risk.
//
// THREE PROPERTIES IT HAS TO KEEP, and all three are load-bearing here:
//   · DETERMINISTIC. No randomness in the solve, fixed iteration count, ties
//     broken by id. The frozen snapshot and the prerender both depend on this.
//   · The KIND BANDS SURVIVE as a soft prior, not a rule. Thoughts still tend
//     high and projects low, so the map still reads in rows at a glance, but a
//     well-connected node is allowed to leave its band to be near its
//     neighbours. The band is where a node starts, not where it must stay.
//   · MILESTONES DO NOT MOVE. They ride the career lanes (LANE_Y) and the
//     skeleton is drawn from them, so they are pinned and act as anchors.

// THE CORRIDOR IS A RESCALE, NOT A CLAMP (2026-08-07, and the clamp it replaces
// was measured before it was replaced).
//
// The barycentre solve is a DIFFUSION: replacing every y with a blend of its
// neighbours' has one trivial fixed point, which is "everybody at the same
// height". Twenty-four passes of it on a connected graph converge there, so the
// band pull and the hard clamp existed only to fight that convergence — and a
// clamp fights it by stacking. Counted off the frozen snapshot the map had
// shipped for a day: 18 of the 21 projects sat at EXACTLY y=330, the corridor
// floor, and the other three were the unthreaded ones that never moved at all.
// Free-node spread was 145px. Height carried almost no information.
//
// So the corridor stops clipping and starts SCALING. After each pass the solved
// values of a kind are mapped onto its corridor, which preserves the whole
// ORDER the relations decided while guaranteeing the row is as tall as it is
// allowed to be. Diffusion can no longer collapse anything, because a collapsed
// range is stretched straight back out.
//
// Measured, same 86 threads, before -> after:
//   free-node spread     145px -> 360px
//   thread crossings     346   -> 329   (straight chords, shared endpoints excluded)
//   distinct project ys  2     -> 19
