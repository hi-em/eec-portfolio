// THE NEURAL WORLD (/thoughts, the meta build; every gate signed by Emilie
// 2026-07-11). The whole record — projects, thoughts, milestones, awards —
// drawn as one anatomical neural map over the horizontal career skeleton,
// full-bleed and drag-explorable, 2021 › NOW. At rest it is quiet points in
// time; it WAKES WHERE YOU LOOK (useProximityEngine.ts, the signed feel).
// Kind lives in the neuron (the landing's mark grammar): filled soma + lens
// nucleus = project · ring + core = thought · small star off its work =
// award · bare commit dot ON the lane = milestone. The ruler is geometric
// and faint, the nerve organic and bright; the contrast is the design; the
// mind owns all motion. TWO VIEWS OF ONE MIND: the landing stays the mind
// at rest; this is the mind in time. The words: each thought's own note page
// (/thoughts/:id), listed in /work's THE THOUGHTS section (the reading room
// and its graph<->words switch retired at the reindex, 2026-07-16).
//
// Copy status: kicker/sub/hint/corridor + h1 "points in time" + LIVE ·
// STILL GROWING all SIGNED in-session (gate 6). The NOW card's three lines
// render from data/now.ts (draftCopy there, unsigned).
//
// Anatomy of a node group (the adversarial review's floors):
// - the ref callbacks are memoized ONCE so hover/focus re-renders never
//   detach handles (detaching would wipe the engine's integrated energies);
// - the dimmable body (dendrites + glow + soma) sits in its own .nw-body
//   wrapper so the wake dim NEVER multiplies into the label's rest ink
//   (0.62 group x 0.62 label would land below the AA floor);
// - the fixed chrome sits BEFORE the stage in the DOM (readers meet the
//   page identity before 40 canvas stops);
// - Escape or a tap on empty field dismisses the card and releases the
//   wake (WCAG 1.4.13); arming on touch is announced via a polite live
//   region so a double-tap that arms is never silent.

 *  It is NOT a second design. Her words: "it should stay the same design that

 *  is most of a 390px phone, so the names had nowhere to go but on top of them.
 *  Squeezed to 0.35 the whole graph occupies the left 106px and the names get a

            jobs. Split, each goes where its job belongs: a key is reference you
            glance at, so it sits at the top where the eye starts, and the
            controls are the one thing you TOUCH, so they sit at the bottom,
            which is the only part of a phone a thumb reaches without
            re-gripping. It also gives the world a line above and a line below,
            which is the header-line/footer-line frame the rest of the site
            already wears.

            doesn't need to be inside a pill for a cleaner look"). She is right,

            these marks and there is nothing for glass to lift them off. A key
            is not chrome, it is a caption; bare on the ground is what a caption

            exactly where its argument was true: on a phone the key is reference

/** THE YEAR RAIL, and the reason it is its own component (the phone-lag fix,
 *  Emilie 2026-08-07: "on the phone it seems a bit laggy").
 *
 *  It reads the scroll position to name the year you are standing in. That
 *  reading lived as state on NeuralWorld, so every time it changed — seven
 *  times across a sweep, and constantly under a drag — React re-rendered the
 *  ENTIRE world: 1559 SVG elements, to relabel one tab.
 *
 *  Measured at 390x844 with the CPU throttled 6x, on the PRODUCTION bundle:
 *  the sweep ran at 9-13fps (mean frame 73-117ms) with a 600-870ms stall
 *  roughly once a second — one per year rule crossed — and snapped back to a
 *  clean 16.7ms the instant it finished. A CPU profile put a third of the time
 *  in the component body and, in dev, 47% in jsxDEV: element creation, not
 *  drawing, not the engine.
 *
 *  Owning the state down here means a year change re-renders a tab and nothing
 *  else. The drawing above never hears about it. */
