// "A simple way to show complexity": at rest the world is quiet points in
// time; neurons NEAR the pointer wake (their dendrites draw out, their
// correlations build to the synapse and fire once), and settle again as
// attention leaves. Emilie's signed feel: RADIUS 180 · BUILD 1400ms ·
// DECAY 3000ms · REST INK 62% · REACH OUT semantics (a waking neuron's
// threads build all the way to their far ends; the far label brightens and
// names the correlation).
//
// Mechanics (pressure-tested): ONE rAF loop; per-node + per-connection
// energies integrated toward their targets; the pointer is sampled IN the
// loop (drag/wheel move the world under a still pointer); canvas mapping
// from a cached stage rect + scale (no per-frame getScreenCTM); writes are
// delta-quantized stroke-dashoffset / opacity only (paint-only properties);
// dt is clamped; the loop self-suspends when everything is settled and no
// input arrives, and pauses with the tab. Reduced motion: the engine never
// starts; the component renders the fully-grown still.
