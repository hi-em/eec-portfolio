// THE OPENINGS (G2): the first sentences of each thought note, VERBATIM.
// The /thoughts index and the CV career graph's field card show these as
// excerpts, so the shelf reads like the notes it holds. Kept in a JSX-free
// module so the graph never drags the full note prose (notes.tsx) into its
// chunk. Update an opening whenever its note's first lines change (notes.tsx
// re-exports this map so the pairing stays visible there).

  bim: "For thirty years we've been getting very good at Building Information Modeling: every beam, every duct, every clash, tracked to the millimeter.",
  neuroaes:
    'Neuroaesthetics is the unglamorous name for a question everyone already feels: why does one room settle you and another keep you on edge?',
  solvers:
    "A physics solver is the most honest collaborator I have: it doesn't care what I intended, only what I actually built.",
  genai:
    'Generative AI made the inspired gesture free. Anyone can produce a thousand renders before lunch, and a render is a promise, not a product.',
  xreal:
    'I started in a lab strapping headsets onto students to see whether a lesson lands harder when you can walk around inside it.',
  comfort:
    "You don't walk into a room and average your experience. You walk in and the thing that's wrong is the thing you notice: the glare, the echo, the cold draft on the back of your neck.",
  drawiface:
    'For most of my life the drawing was the output. You designed the thing, then you drew it to prove it existed.',
  evosearch:
    'Evolutionary search is what I reach for when a problem is too tangled to solve head on: describe what good looks like, then let a population of designs breed, mutate, and compete until something clever falls out.',
  heritage:
    'The usual choice with an old building is a trap: treat it as a museum piece no one may touch, or drop a glass-and-steel box in the middle and call it modern.',
  respond:
    'Right now a building is a fixed guess. Someone chose the ceiling height and the window size years before you arrived, and you live inside their averaged assumptions whether they fit you or not.',
  charcoal:
    'When the art class was asked who here dislikes drawing, mine was the only hand that went up. Awkward.',
  // (pelagnou cut 2026-07-29, note and all.)
  explain:
    'How do you explain a complex, honestly boring technical subject so someone leans in instead of glazing over?',
  adjacency:
    'A floor plan tells you which rooms touch. It will not tell you which rooms you can actually reach, and the gap between those two drawings is where the architecture is hiding.',
  // THE WORDS (2026-07-28). Each of these four is the VERBATIM first sentence
  // of its note, and each carries a findable noun in the first line on purpose
  // (data, large language model, machine learning, score): they are the
  // vocabulary notes, so the word being explained has to be in the excerpt a
  // reader meets on the index and in the route's meta description, which is
  // derived from this string.
  learning:
    'You learned what a room does to you by being in rooms. Nobody sat you down with a dataset.',
  llm: 'A large language model is a machine that guesses the next word. That is not me being kind to you, that is the whole thing.',
  latent:
    'Machine learning borrowed the word space from us, and I would like to check what it did with it.',
  scoring:
    'I build things that give a room a score. The obvious next question, and the one I would ask me, is what happens the day somebody uses that score to decide who gets the room.',
  rules:
    'Computation is not the same as using a computer, and separating the two took me longer than I would like to admit.',
  dark: 'So your eyes signal your brain when they see light? Well, no. It is literally the opposite.',
