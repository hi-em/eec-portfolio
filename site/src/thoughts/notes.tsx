        For thirty years we've been getting very good at Building Information Modeling: every beam,
        every duct, every clash, tracked to the millimeter. It's a magnificent way to describe a
        building, and it says almost nothing about the person standing inside it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep circling one reframing. Keep the letters, change the noun. What if the B was never
        the building? Building Information Modeling becomes Behavior Information Modeling: the
        same rigor and the same appetite for data, pointed at how a room acts on the body instead
        of how the structure holds itself up. Ceiling height, daylight, the curve of a wall, the
        plants in the corner. None of that is decoration. It's input, and the mind has outputs.

        The honest version of the claim is small. I can't measure your cortisol from a floor plan

        evidence-based design research that already exists, estimate the direction it pushes you, and

        Neuroaesthetics is the unglamorous name for a question everyone already feels: why does one
        room settle you and another keep you on edge? The field has spent years building actual
        evidence for it, complexity and coherence in a facade, the pull of a curve over a hard
        corner, the way a closed room puts cortisol in your blood.

        The poetics of a curve live in what you leave out. Shade the big shapes honestly, let the
        small truths stay foggy, and the figure reads clearer, not less: which is how seeing works
        anyway. Nobody takes a room in detail by detail; you catch the big picture and your mind
        fills in the rest.

        Listening is the same lesson from the other side. An ear has no lid; it stays open all

        arriving with a story to tell, a question to ask, and you choosing to receive it. And the
        anatomy is in on it: the three smallest bones in the body live in there, next to the sense
        of balance. The organ that listens is the organ that keeps you standing.

        Maybe that's the real subject: not the things, the space between them. Drawing a figure
        pulling on a rope, what comes out is the pull itself: no face, the rope barely there,
        everything leaning toward a force you can't draw directly, only show. The connection is the

        A floor plan tells you which rooms touch. It will not tell you which rooms you can
        actually reach, and the gap between those two drawings is where the architecture is
        hiding. In a graph machine learning course at IAAC I took a police station in Salt,
        Spain and rebuilt it three times as a graph: once for which rooms touch, once for
        which rooms you can walk between, once for which rooms can see each other. The
        notebook scaffolds came with the course. The building, the argument for choosing it,
        and every analysis on top of it were mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        A police station is an extreme case of designed spatial control. Its plan keeps three
        groups of people apart, public, staff and detainees, whose paths are not supposed to
        cross by accident, and it rations every crossing through a door. Officers need to
        survey rooms they are not standing in. If a plan encodes a protocol anywhere, it
        encodes one here, which makes it the right thing to point a graph at.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first graph connects any two rooms that share a wall. The second connects them
        only if there is a door in that wall. Subtract one from the other and what is left is
        not noise, it is the design: every place where two rooms were allowed to touch and
        deliberately not allowed to connect. Adjacency is not access. The interesting result
        was a gap, not a number, which is why both graphs are built and not just the useful
        one.

        This is not an idle parallel, it is the premise under everything I build. Scoring a
        room against neuroarchitecture research is only ever saying: other bodies have been in
        rooms like this one, here is what happened to them, would you like to know before you
        pour the concrete? The research is the dataset. It is small and awkward and full of
        holes, and it is still more than a hunch.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I cannot decide is whether that makes the tool a colleague or a very well read
        stranger who has never once been in the room.

        LLM stands for large language model, which is to say a large model of language. Thank
        you, very helpful. It might be the least informative acronym in a field with a lot of
        competition, so let me come at it backwards and start with what it is not.

        It is not a database. When you ask it something it is not looking anything up: no drawer,
        no row, no record with your answer already sitting in it. It has read more than any person
        could and it remembers none of it the way you remember a phone number.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not understanding you either. It has no idea what a wall is. What it has is an
        extremely good statistical sense of which words tend to follow <em>load bearing</em>,
        which is exactly why it can hand you a sentence that sounds like structural advice and is
        wrong, without anything registering that a mistake occurred.

        And here is the part I cannot tidy away, because this would be a better note if I could
        stop at three: it is not just autocomplete either. Guessing the next word, at that scale,
        produced things nobody put in on purpose. It writes working code. It holds an argument
        across paragraphs. Not one of the people who built it can tell you why that showed up.
        Though people argue about whether it was ever a jump: mark the answers right or wrong
        and you get a cliff, mark how close they got and the same models climb smoothly.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I work with it the way you would work with a very fast, very well read colleague who
        has never once said I do not know. I check. Every time I have not checked I have paid for
        it later, and the bill always arrives after you have told someone it is fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built something that guesses, and the guessing turned out to be enough for most of what
        we ask of it. I still cannot tell whether that is a fact about the machine or about the
        questions.

        Machine learning borrowed the word space from us, and I would like to check what it did
        with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A model turns everything it has seen into points. Not pictures, not words: coordinates,
        in a space with hundreds or thousands of axes, none of which anyone chose or can name.
        Things that behave alike end up near each other. That is the entire trick, and it is a
        spatial argument made almost entirely by people who do not think of themselves as
        spatial.
      </p>
      {LatentFigure}
      <p>
        Near means similar. Direction means something even when nobody can say what. There are
        neighbourhoods, there are dense parts and thin parts, and the thin parts are exactly
        where a model will invent something with total confidence.
        <NBDot note="an axis nobody named is still an axis." align="right" />
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to be careful not to oversell the metaphor. A latent space has no floor, no
        gravity and no up. You cannot stand in it and it does not care about your body, which
        is precisely what makes it useful and precisely why I would not hand it a room and walk
        away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still. We are the discipline that has spent three thousand years on what near means.
        Somebody from here should probably be in that room.

        I build things that give a room a score. The obvious next question, and the one I would
        ask me, is what happens the day somebody uses that score to decide who gets the room.
      </p>
      <p>
        A score is small, portable and confident. That is what makes it useful and it is also
        the entire problem: it travels much further than the caveats attached to it, and
        nobody, ever, forwards the methodology.

      {ScoreFigure}

        The version I actually lose sleep over is not a villain. It is a spreadsheet. Somebody
        sorts by the column, the low scoring floor quietly becomes the cheap floor, and a
        number I wrote to help a designer argue is suddenly doing allocation. I did not build
        the thing that does that. I built the column.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the tools say out loud what they are. They score and they estimate, they never
        measure and never diagnose, the weights are public so you can disagree with them, and I
        wrote agreement is not truth into the notes so the warning ships with the product. That
        is not a disclaimer. It is a design constraint, and it costs something every time.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of it stops the spreadsheet. It only means that when somebody opens the file, the
        argument is already in there waiting for them.

        Computation is not the same as using a computer, and separating the two took me longer
        than I would like to admit. You can draw in software for ten years and never compute
        anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference is what you hand over. Drawing means deciding where the wall goes.
        Computing means describing the rule that decides where the wall goes, and then living
        with what that rule does at the eightieth wall, when you are no longer watching.

      {ComputationFigure}
      <p>
        Which sounds like losing control and is mostly the opposite. A rule can be argued with.
        You hand it to someone, they find the case you did not think of, and the disagreement is
        about reasoning instead of taste. Try having that argument about a line.

        had been given: connected, supported, made of parts that exist. It had also stopped reading

        described the problem badly.

        So computation moves the work upstream, into saying what you actually want, which turns

        So your eyes signal your brain when they see light? Well, no. It is literally the
        opposite. In the dark, the rods at the back of your eye fire the whole night, a steady
        report that nothing is happening, and when light lands on one it goes quiet. The quiet is
        the signal. The title is Hannah Fry's, from{' '}

        last week, and I would never have thought it worked that way. Now I keep wondering how
        many other things work backwards from what we assume. In the senses? In architecture? In
        the tech I build with?
      </p>
      {SilenceFigure}
      <p>
        To be exact, because I got this wrong on the first listen: it is the rods that go quiet,
        not the brain. The cells behind them read the silence and pass it on, and by the time the
        message reaches the cortex it is a signal like any other. The backwards step is the first
        one, in the retina. And it is not a quirk of the retina. It is the current best guess about
        how the whole brain works: you do not receive the room, you guess it, top down, and the
        senses send back only
        the difference between the guess and what arrived. The expected thing produces no signal
        at all. The cells that hand out dopamine do the same, firing for the reward you did not
        see coming, silent for the one you did, and dipping when the one you expected never
        shows. Which is why you never hear the fridge until it stops.

        It took me a week to notice that this is exactly what{' '}
        <Ref id="llm">a language model</Ref> does. It guesses the next word, and it turns out so
        do you: put electrodes on people listening to a podcast and the cortex predicts each word
        before it lands, then reports the surprise. In{' '}
        <Ref id="learning">experiences are data</Ref> I asked whether we had described one
        process twice in two vocabularies. Apparently we had. The difference is what happens
        after the guess. Mine is corrected every second by my own senses; the model was corrected
        once, in training, and never again. And I have a second way to cancel an error that no
        model has: I can get up and move the plant.

        Now put a building in front of it. A facade the brain predicts perfectly, the same window
        forty times, produces no signal. So a boring building is not a matter of taste. It is
        literally less stimulating, because it was predicted. Colin Ellard walked people past a
        blank Whole Foods wall in Manhattan and their arousal dropped, and they said so, and

        campaign has been arguing since 2023 that boring buildings are bad for us. This is at
        least a mechanism for why: nothing wrong, nothing to report, nothing happening in you. I
        want to be careful, because the opposite failure exists and every airport proves it. A
        room that surprises you at every step is not stimulating, it is exhausting. The old
        research on this has a shape, an inverted U, and comfort sits somewhere on the slope, not
        at either end.

        Which leaves me with a drawing problem. <Ref id="sensi">Sensi</Ref> scores a room across
        six senses, and right now a perfect score is a full bar, the way every score bar since
        scores began has been full. Maybe it should be the opposite. If comfort is the sense
        going quiet, the honest drawing is the empty one: the comfortable room is the one with
        nothing to report, and a full bar is a room that would not stop talking. The wrong thing
        is the thing you notice, I wrote in <Ref id="comfort">comfort as data</Ref>, before I
        knew why. So do I redraw it? And would anyone trust a tool that shows them nothing?
