// THE THOUGHT FIGURES · THE PLATE (THE WORDS, Emilie's ruling 2026-07-28,
// board look 2 of 3: "let's go for the plate").
//
// Her ask was for a STYLE, not for drawings: "some are plots, some graphs,
// some diagrams, some sketches, some abstract, some maths equations or graphs
// you know?" So the board drew three candidate looks across the same four
// kinds, and this is the one she picked, built as a system: one <Fig> holding
// a drawing in the ink grammar already signed for the /work plates, held
// between two hairlines, captioned in the mono micro type.
//
// THE GRAMMAR LIVES IN CSS (language.css, .thought-fig), not here, so a
// drawing below is only geometry. Classes: .ln the ink line · .th the thin
// line · .ax an axis · .dash an absent relationship · .dt a dot · .ac / .acs
// THE ONE ACCENT PER DRAWING, never two · text.lbl a mono label · text.mth
// maths, set in the serif italic.
//
// WHEN A NOTE WANTS A PLATE AND WHEN IT WANTS A SKETCH DOT: if the prose spends
// a paragraph describing a shape, it wants a plate (it is carrying the
// argument). If the prose is remembering something, it wants the dot
// (SketchDot, her 2026-07-18 mechanism, which floats a charcoal in the margin).
// Both now exist and neither replaces the other.
//
// THE VIEWBOX IS 300x170 for every figure, so a reader's eye does not have to
// re-scale between one note and the next, and so nothing here can quietly
// become a hero image. A figure that needs a different aspect is a sign the
// idea wants two figures.
//
// AND EVERY DRAWING FILLS IT, roughly y=22 to y=150. The first pass did not:
// the drawings sat in the middle third with dead air above and below, which at
// 460px wide reads as a small picture stranded in a large frame rather than as
// a plate. Caught on screen, not in the source. If a new figure looks weak,
// check its extents before reaching for a heavier stroke.
//
// PRINT: the book (src/print/) renders notes only as excerpts, so no figure
// reaches paper today. If that changes, these are inline SVG and will print as
// they stand; nothing here depends on hover, script or colour to be readable
// (the accent is reinforced by the caption every time, per the colour-never-
// means-alone rule).

 * THE FIGURE NUMBER (Emilie, 2026-08-05). Her instruction: "imagine them all
 * piled up in one document as a book of essays, so the figures have to be
 * numbered in that way."
 *
 * So numbering is a RUNNING COUNT over the whole set in reading order, oldest
 * note first: Fig. 1 is the plate in the earliest thought that has one, and the
 * count carries straight through to Fig. 17. It is not per-note. A first pass
 * numbered them `Fig. T-101.1`, which tied each plate to its own note and was
 * the wrong shape: that is a catalogue, and she asked for a book.
 *
 * NOTHING IS TYPED. The order is `thoughtIndexEntries()` reversed, so it is the
 * same single source the /work list and the book index run on, just ascending:
 * date first, T-number as the tie-break for the five months that hold two notes.
 * A figure therefore cannot disagree with the record, and re-dating a thought
 * renumbers every plate after it automatically.
 *
 * THE COST, worth stating: a figure number is a POSITION, not an identity.
 * Insert a thought early and everything downstream shifts, which is exactly how
 * a book behaves and exactly unlike the permanent T-numbers. Cite a plate by
 * its note, never by its number.
