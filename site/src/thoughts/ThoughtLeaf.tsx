// thought inside the frozen frame (SheetPage): the HEADER LINE carries all
// the thought's info (its meta: kind, date, lens, number) AND the nav
// controls (All Thoughts, In Time, Next, each an icon + its own colour); the
// CONTENT is just the title + the words, scrolling on an invisible wheel
// between the frozen header and footer. The pillar door retired from the
// leaf (Emilie 2026-07-19: "only all thoughts, next and in time"); the
// pillar still links out to its cluster. No panel under the prose (glass is
// for UI, not words); the SKETCH DOT is the one sanctioned figure (S5).
