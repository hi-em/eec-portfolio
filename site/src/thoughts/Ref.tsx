// THE REFERENCE LINK (THE WORDS, Emilie's ruling 2026-07-29): when a note
// names a project or another note, the name itself is the door.
//
// "if a thought mentions a project let the project name be a link same system
// as the cv, so everything feels connected" ... and then, importantly:
// "we should also add links if thoughts are mentioned inside thoughts and we
// should encourage actually that, because thoughts are also connected and
// that's the whole idea of the mind, and how you form new neurons."
//
// So this deliberately does NOT distinguish the two. One component, one look:
// naming a project and naming a thought are the same gesture, and the site's
// argument is that they are the same kind of thing. Cross-referencing between
// notes is something to reach for, not to ration.
//
// SAME SYSTEM AS THE CV, in spirit: there the linkable name is the LEADING
// word of a bullet and the rest of the sentence stays flat, so the record
// still reads as a document rather than a link farm (data/cv.ts,
// splitProjectLink). Here the equivalent restraint is that only the NAME is
// live, never the clause around it, and a note should not name the same thing
// twice as a link.
//
// THE ROUTE IS DERIVED, NEVER TYPED. It reads the registry, which is the
// single source for both /work/:id and /thoughts/:id, so a note can never
// point at an address that does not exist. An unknown id renders as plain
// text rather than a dead link, and refs.test.ts fails the build for it, so
// the failure is loud at build time and harmless at run time.
