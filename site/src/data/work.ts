// THE WORK RENDITION (Session R2, grown into the SHOWCASE at G1).
//
// ONE CONTENT, TWO RENDITIONS: this file derives the exact object that both
// the /work grid AND the printed book's INDEX page (R7) map over. The
// registry stays the single source (project entries, sheet number/status,
// the award refIds); the MASTER CONTENT FILES (src/content/projects/, G1)
// carry everything the project says: card copy AND the showcase spine.
// Nothing is authored here; it is composed here.
//
// THE HERO RULE (Emilie, 2026-07-09): the opened showcase leads with the
// work, and one hero is chosen by a fixed priority from the assets a project
// has:
//
//     video  >  live app  >  photo  >  audio  >  text
//
// Everything else falls into supporting roles (extra photos -> strip, award ->
// recognition line, tech -> mono row). The rule is data-driven, so a new
// project picks its member automatically and the gallery needs zero layout
// work per entry (THE ECONOMY: cheap to update from the registry).
//
// THE SHOWCASE, NOT A PREVIEW (G1, Emilie's model change executed): the
// opened card IS the project's whole page, deep-linkable at /work/:id. Its
// spine (signed 2026-07-10): WHAT · WHY · HOW · WHAT CAME OF IT, then tools,
// then links OUT to repo / blog / live. Depth stays in the linked repo/blog;
// the Pen Table sheet tier retired with G1 (/sheets/* redirects here).
