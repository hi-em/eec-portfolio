// THE TWO RECORDS MUST AGREE (Emilie's ruling 2026-08-06, and it is the ask
// that matters most in this file): "make sure it's all reflected always, make
// it a system that whatever we change in the cv or the commit graph in the map
// it should always be in a way reflected somehow if chosen."
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. The site keeps her history in two places on purpose. The CV
// (data/cv.ts) is prose written for a human reader and a parser; the registry
// (data/registry.ts) is a dated census the world map, the head, the sitemap and
// the book all read. They will never be generated from each other, because the
// CV groups and rewords ("Jury and studio awards at IAAC: lEgoarCh, The Lungs,
// The Huddle" is one line for three registry entries).
//
// So the guarantee is not "identical". It is: NOTHING IS ON ONE SURFACE BY
// ACCIDENT. Every milestone and award in the registry either answers to a CV
// line, or is named below as deliberately map-only, and vice versa. Adding a
// fact to either side without deciding about the other fails this test.
//
// WHAT THE 2026-08-06 AUDIT FOUND, which is what the guard is calibrated to:
//   · one job with two titles (the map said Project Architect, the CV said
//     Design Technology Architect, for six weeks)
//   · The Huddle's award filed under 2025 on the map and 2026 on the CV
//   · a licence and a summer school on the CV and nowhere else
//   · a Biennale entry in the registry that rendered on no surface at all

// ---- the reconciliation table ----------------------------------------------
// Each entry pins BOTH SIDES: `cv` is a phrase that must appear somewhere in the
// CV, `map` is a phrase that must appear in that registry entry's own title.
// `cv: null` is a DECISION and needs a reason beside it.
//
// ⚠ TWO FIELDS, NOT ONE, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. The first version of this
// table held only the CV phrase, and it PASSED while the exact bug it was
// written for was reintroduced: with `cv: 'Dynamic Solution'` the check stayed
// green whether the map said Design Technology Architect or Project Architect,
// because the CV contains the employer either way. A guard that cannot fail is
// not a guard. Pinning the map side too is what makes a change on either
// surface break the test, which is what she actually asked for.
//
// The two phrases are usually different on purpose: the CV is written for a
// human and a parser ("Bachelor of Architecture"), the map is a dated mark on a
// drawing ("B.ARCH"). Requiring them to match would force one register onto
// both. Requiring each to be present keeps them honest without merging them.
