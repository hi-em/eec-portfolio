// Web CV. Source: old material/Emilie El Chidiac - Résumé.pdf (Feb 2025)
// + MaCAD year additions per PORTFOLIO-REBRAND-BRIEF.md. G5 (2026-07-12):
// the downloadable PDF renders FROM THIS FILE at build time
// (src/print/PrintCV.tsx + scripts/render-pdfs.mjs), so editing here
// regenerates it on the next build and it can never go stale. The build's
// ATS parse test extracts the PDF's text layer and fails if the dates,
// email, or section order stop reading plainly.
// G3 (2026-07-10, REDESIGN-SPEC §9): real ATS-readable dates ("Aug 2024 -
// Present", plain hyphens, no em dashes anywhere), skills regrouped to the
// four spec groups ("Rhino Compute" spelled with a space once, on purpose),
// certificates carry the full issuer name.
//
// THE CV PASS (2026-07-27, Emilie's rulings live in-session). What changed:
//
// 1. PROJECTS ARE NAMED IN PLACE. There is no SELECTED WORK section and there
//    will not be one: every project sits under the degree or the role that
//    produced it (the `projects` field), so nothing can repeat itself and each
//    one arrives with its context already attached. Her call, and it also let
//    the six newer projects (Homage, Encounter, Falcon, and the explorations)
//    onto the CV at no structural cost.
// 2. EDUCATION LEADS. Her call. Eye-tracking research puts the highest-
//    attention slot right after the name, and her most recent role is the one
//    whose project work cannot be disclosed; MaCAD + the 2026 award belong
//    there instead.
// 3. THE AWARDS BLOCK SURVIVES but holds every recognition ONCE. Projects are
//    named bare above; the recognitions live here, each naming its project.
//    FLAG-07: externally verifiable ones carry the context that makes them
//    checkable (Tamayouz's 422 teams), course-internal ones name IAAC plainly.
//    Weight comes from detail, not from a subhead that would demote the MaCAD
//    win (which is course-internal AND her headline claim).
// 4. THE DEGREE STRING IS NOW VERBATIM off the diploma. Never "official
//    master's degree" (it is a título propio; 90 ECTS, and that is honestly
//    claimable, but the word "official" is not).
// 5. SKILLS keep their four tier labels and change their contents: the AI group
//    re-weights onto what still discriminates in 2026 (agents, and evaluation
//    and benchmarking), because AI-assisted development is now table stakes.
//    Two new groups: DOMAIN (the vocabulary a hiring manager actually uses for
//    this subject) and WRITING & RESEARCH (which answers "can she communicate"
//    and "is there a research cycle", both previously blank).
// 6. FOCUS became a headline + a summary and now renders on the SCREEN too,
//    not just the PDF.
//
// draftCopy: FOCUS, every `projects` string, the DOMAIN and WRITING & RESEARCH
// groups, and the re-weighted award lines are all DRAFTED, unsigned.
//
// Honesty ceilings that bind this file (verified 2026-07-27 against the
// project masters and the local calibration): Tamayouz is Top 100, never
// "winner" · Marsception is Top 50, duo-credited to Charles Abi Chahine ·
// Sensi is "project lead, team of four", no percentages · lEgoarCh is
// "digitally verified buildable", never physically assembled · The Lungs stays
// proposal tense ("designed to filter") · FALCON SQUARE CARRIES NO
// RECOGNITION (Emilie's ruling 2026-07-27; the dossier's S2 ruling 2 had
// conflated it with The Encounter's Cemetery Challenge certificate) · the neuro
// verbs are score / estimate / model, never "measure" · Dynamic Solution is the
// current job, so the role appears and its project work does not.

// One record entry. `projects` is the in-place project line added at the CV
// pass: optional, because Dynamic Solution (the current job) cannot name its
// work and two of the older roles have none worth a line.

// DATE FORMAT (her audit, 2026-07-27, AMENDED BY HER 2026-08-26): EXPERIENCE
// carries month + year on every entry. EDUCATION carried none at all, and now
// carries them on the MaCAD entry ONLY: at the recruiter pass she ruled the
// degree must show "Sep 2025 - Dec 2026" so a reader can see she is FINISHING,
// which is the one fact a dateless education block cannot say. The bachelor
// stays dateless knowingly (raised with her): the end date of a degree in
// progress is load-bearing, the end date of one completed years ago is not. The
// earlier hybrid (months on the recent roles, bare years on the older two)
// was defensible on parsing grounds and still read as an inconsistency to a
// human, which is the reader who was going to notice.
// THE RECRUITER PASS (2026-08-26) re-measured this ceiling off the shipped
// PDF rather than trusting the number: the text column's right edge is 547pt,
// the longest surviving bullet ends at 544pt, and a character costs ~4pt. Every
// bullet touched this pass was fitted against those numbers and re-measured in
// the rebuilt PDF, not estimated.
// EVERY BULLET IS ONE PRINTED LINE (her call, 2026-07-27). A bullet that wraps
// for the sake of two words reads as sloppy, so each string below is written
// to a measured ceiling of roughly 118 characters at 8.6pt across the A4
// measure. If you edit one, re-measure: the build's overflow probe only
// catches the page total, never a single ugly widow.

// ---- THE PROJECT NAME IS A DOOR (board B1, her ruling 2026-07-28) ----------
//
// The web CV's one interactive move, and it needed no new data: because every
// project is NAMED IN PLACE under the degree or role that produced it, the
// link was already written into the bullets above. It just was not clickable.
//

// flat text, so the record still reads as a document rather than a link farm,
// and a reader's eye lands on the same word it would have landed on anyway.
//
// WHY THIS IS A MAP AND NOT A FIELD ON `projects`: the bullets are also the
// PRINTED CV (src/print/PrintCV.tsx renders these exact strings, and the
// build's ATS parse test reads the resulting text layer). Threading a link
// type through them would push a web-only concern into the one artifact that
// must stay plain text. A lookup keeps the strings untouched and the print
// page entirely unaware this exists.
//
// The AWARDS block is deliberately NOT linked. Its lines name projects too,
// but they name them mid-sentence and every target except The Huddle is
// already reachable from a bullet above; linking them would put seven links
// into six short lines and turn the recognitions into navigation.
//

//
// This section NAMED two addresses and linked neither, which is the one thing
// a printed CV is forced to do and a web page has no excuse for. The line is
// now three PARTS, each with the span that should be a destination isolated
// from the prose around it.
//
// WRITING is still assembled from those parts and is BYTE-IDENTICAL to the
// string it was before, because the print page and the build's ATS parse test
// both read it: the structure is added for the screen and costs the paper
// nothing. cv.test.ts pins the joined string so a future edit to a part cannot
// quietly change what the PDF says.
//
// `to` is an internal route, `href` an external site. FLAG: blog.iaac.net has
// no author archive that I could find, so that one lands on the blog's front
// page rather than on her twelve write-ups. If IAAC has an author URL, it
// belongs here.

// draftCopy: the summary under the header, unsigned. Structure is a headline
// (the locked title string, rendered separately) plus this summary: research is
// consistent that they are different instruments and that pairing them beats
// choosing one. The "of course" is Emilie's and it is load-bearing: it concedes
// the table-stakes thing in two words so the actual claim can land.
// "computational design" and "parametric design" are NOT here on purpose; they
// live in the CRAFT row, which is what the build's keyword assertion reads.
// The one phrase that must never split across lines: it is the joke, and a
// joke broken in half is not one. Both renderers wrap this exact substring in
// a nowrap span. A non-breaking space was tried first and FAILED, because the
// hyphen in "AI-assisted" is itself a break opportunity and Chrome took it.

// opening with Rhino/Grasshopper so the research/AI identity could lead. It was
// stress-tested at her instruction and the reorder was ARGUED DOWN: for her
// strongest honest fit (computational design in a practice) Rhino + Grasshopper
// IS the screened baseline, an ATS ranks on presence rather than position, and
// a reader of a two-line summary reads both lines. The real defect was content,
// not order: the header's only AI content was a JOKE conceding that AI is table
// stakes, so the top of the page claimed no AI capability at all. Her ruling:
// the additive tweak. Both signed sentences are untouched, byte for byte.

// string, which meant it was wrong the day after anyone forgot to bump it.

// served as a static file, so nothing executes when a visitor downloads it.
// The build date is the honest equivalent and answers the same question, how
// current is this file, because the file is regenerated on every deploy.
//
// Evaluated when the print page renders, which under `npm run build` is the
// moment headless Chrome prints the PDF. Safe from hydration drift because no
// screen route displays it: /cv dropped the stamp deliberately.
// Long form, because the BOOK renders it as "UPDATED JULY 2026" via
// toUpperCase(). The CV dropped its own stamp entirely (her call 2026-07-27:
// the date is not important enough to spend a line on), so this export now
// serves the book alone.
