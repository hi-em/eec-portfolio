//   0.003pt | ", with Dr. Cleo Valentine"

// is also simply what the bytes say — pdf.js's own text-layer builder and
// pdfminer both position runs rather than assuming separators.
// The threshold is a quarter of the smallest space on the sheet (7pt mono
// measures 2.05pt), which sits an order of magnitude clear of both cases.

//
// ⚠ THE GRAMMAR IS THE BOOK'S, deliberately, because the book's was argued
// down twice already (see assertLinks below): DISTINCT TARGETS, never
// annotation counts — Chrome emits one /Link per inline text run, so a JSX
// tidy-up moves the annotation total and means nothing — and PER SURFACE,
// never one global sum, because a surplus on one surface hides the total loss

// the only thing that sees that, and it cannot go stale, because both sides

// empty list is true, so a rotted `.pr-ats a[href]` selector would make the
// agreement check vacuous and green. The four contact targets are therefore

//       data the book renders from, so the expectations cannot go stale.

// THE HOUSE STYLE (the consistency pass, Emilie's rulings, 2026-08-19). Five
// agents measured the built book — footer geometry, margins as spreads, a font
// census, a color census, baseline rhythm — and every drift they found was
// ruled on. These four laws are the rulings, re-measured from the PDF BYTES on
// every build so none of them can reopen quietly:
//   1 · THE FOOT. It used to JUMP 6.1mm at every page turn (plates derived
//       theirs from flow padding, asset pages pinned theirs to a hemline) and
//       the folio wandered between three distances from the trim. One
//       baseline now, one folio edge — and after her judgment round
//       (2026-08-19, "i want things centered") no parity mirror either.
//   2 · THE UNIFORM FRAME. 12mm on every side of every page (her ruling,
//       2026-08-19: "top, bottom, left, right, all margin at 12mm"). This
//       replaced the bound-book mirror (18mm gutter / 12mm outer, flipping
//       by parity), which on screens read as the footer wandering.
//   3 · THE FONT ALLOWLIST. Four families, and a pinned size set: the index
//       deks printed at a size no stylesheet declared for MONTHS before the
//       census caught it. Pages whose DOM carries drawn <svg> text (the cover
//       art, the two drawn figures) are checked by family only — their sizes
//       are viewBox units scaled by the page, not typography.
//   4 · THE COLOR ALLOWLIST. The site's tokens plus the print pens, exactly.
//       The book carried THREE faint grays within one bit of each other until
//       this pass; a color a hair off its token now fails by name. The red is
//       law: #be123c bit-exact, and anything NEAR red fails harder.
const MMPT = 72 / 25.4
